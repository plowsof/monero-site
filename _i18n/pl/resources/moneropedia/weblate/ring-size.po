msgid "Ring size refers to the total number of signers in a @ring-signature. Before release [0.13.0 \"Beryllium Bullet\"]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018/10/11/monero-0.13.0-released.html), it was possible to select an arbitrary number of signers. With release 0.13, it was decided to set this number to 11 to enforce transaction uniformity."
